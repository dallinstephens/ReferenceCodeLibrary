  <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

  <p>It is my belief that knowledge of the basics for each programming language will help me be a great asset to any company, organize code for quick assess, increase my skills, be more efficient, create clean code, and become an advanced programmer and analyst. To help you know my ability, I created sample pages for some of the programminmg languages to illustrate the basics of what I know. Please select a programming language from the left menu column, select a subject, and then hover over each of the items for each subject to display each sample page. Some of the programming languages have content while others do not because I am still working on this project.</p>

  <p>The best way to contact me is by email. I check my email frequently so I will do my best to respond within twenty-four hours. You are also welcome to call or text me. If you call me, please leave a voice message and I will promptly return your call.</p>

  <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I am excited for the potential opportunity to work with you and a great company!</p>
